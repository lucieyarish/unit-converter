## About

This solo project was build entirely by me while learning JavaScript basics through Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). Figma design was provided by Scrimba and adjusted by me (I added a toggle button to switch between light and dark mode).

Basic requirements for this project were to:

- Build the project from scratch in order to practice concepts taught in the course
- Follow the Figma [design spec](https://www.figma.com/file/cqtGul0V8RFXY4vTcIv1Kc/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A1)
- Generate all conversions when user clicks "Convert"
- Round the numbers down to three decimal places

Stretch goals added by me:

- Add dark/light mode button
- Generate conversions on "Enter" key press as well

Total dev time: 2 hours
